Highlights
1. We established a large-scale metabolomic cohort of early- to mid-stage lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) with full clinical annotation.
2. LUAD presenting as ground-glass opacities (GGOs) and solid nodules (SNs) exhibited distinct metabolic profiles. This distinction was further substantiated in a cohort of multiple primary lung cancer (MPLC) cases, suggesting that the metabolic divergence reflects an intrinsic tumor feature rather than interindividual metabolic variability.
3. Using a focused cohort of mixed GGOs (mGGOs), we found that the ground-glass (GG) and solid components shared similar metabolic profiles, both closely resembling the pattern observed in pure GGOs.
4. Through multi-cohort integration of 16S rRNA and transcriptomic data, combined with in vitro validation, we identified linoleic acid metabolism as a key contributor to LUAD progression.
